CQEngine is a NoSQL database engine for performing SQL-like queries on standard Java collections, with the goal of returning results faster than iteration would allow. Response times are in the order of _microseconds_.

CQEngine is somewhat similar to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query Microsoft LINQ], or [http://code.google.com/p/lambdaj/ LambdaJ for Java], but internally CQEngine uses indexing and set theory rather than iteration to process queries.
