===Version 1.1.1 - 2013-08-18===
 * Additional work on `ReflectiveAttribute` to play nicer with inherited fields (issue 18)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.1.0 - 2013-08-16===
 * Updated `RadixTreeIndex`, `ReversedRadixTreeIndex`, `InvertedRadixTreeIndex`, `SuffixTreeIndex` to use [http://code.google.com/p/concurrent-trees/wiki/ReleaseNotes concurrent-trees library 2.1] for lower memory usage and lower latency (issue 14)
 * Added `CQEngine.newObjectLockingInstance(int concurrencyLevel)` providing object-level locking on the write path for applications in which threads might race each other to add/remove the same object (issue 9)
 * Bugfix to hashCode implementation in Not.java, would reduce collisions if queries stored in hash maps (issue 13)
 * Added support to `SimpleAttribute` to specify generic types manually via constructor to bypass reflection (issue 17)
 * Bugfix to `ReflectiveAttribute` to allow it to access private fields (issue 18)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.3 - 2012-12-07===
 * Added new type of index, `UniqueIndex`, with thanks to Kinz Liu (issue 8) - can be used with primary-key type attributes to reduce memory usage and yield faster query performance
 * Added `ReflectiveAttribute` - reflection-based attribute, for trading performance for convenience/flexibility/simplifying dynamic queries in some cases (issue 6)
 * Added benchmarks for indexing overhead (issue 7)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.2 - 2012-11-22===
 * Added support for Has queries - `has(Car.DESCRIPTION)` and `not(has(Car.DESCRIPTION))` - the equivalent of SQL `IS NOT NULL` and `IS NULL` respectively. Use with `SimpleNullableAttribute`. These queries can be accelerated via `StandingQueryIndex`
 * Bugfix to updating compound indexes for objects added/removed after index added
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.1 - 2012-11-17===
 * Added support for customizing via factories, the construction of maps and sets used internally by `HashIndex`, `NavigableIndex` and `CompoundIndex` (concurrency level, load factor etc.) (issue 5)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.0 - 2012-10-29===
 * Added support for attributes returning null values via `SimpleNullableAttribute`, `MultiValueNullableAttribute` (issue 2)
 * Bugfix to `ResultSet.uniqueResult()` (issue 4)
 * API same as in 0.9.1, no code changes necessary
 * Deployed to Maven central
