= Benchmark Setup =

The following benchmarks were run on a 1.8GHz Intel Core i7 !MacBook Air with OS X 10.7.4 and Java 1.6.0_26. All benchmarks were each run 10,000 times as a warmup, before running 10,000 times again for measurement. Garbage collection was performed before each measurement. Source code for the benchmark framework logic can be found [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/testutil/ here] and [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/BenchmarkRunner.java here]. Source code for individual benchmarks is referenced below.

The original tab-separated output from the benchmark is available as a spreadsheet [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/documents/benchmark-results.ods here].

*The benchmark is based on the example of an online car dealership*.

The dealership has a website with a catalogue of 100,000 cars. So it has a collection of 100,000 `Car` objects. Every car object has a number of fields containing the price, manufacturer, model, color, number of doors etc. For the purpose of the example, assume Cars are simple immutable objects as follows.
{{{
public class Car {
    enum Color {RED, GREEN, BLUE, BLACK, WHITE}
    public final int carId;
    public final String manufacturer;
    public final String model;
    public final Color color;
    public final int doors;
    public final double price;

    public Car(int carId, String manufacturer, String model, Color color, int doors, double price) {
        this.carId = carId;
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.doors = doors;
        this.price = price;
    }
}
}}}

This method can create a collection of such cars:
{{{
    public static Set<Car> createCollectionOfCars(int numCars) {
        Set<Car> cars = new LinkedHashSet<Car>(numCars);
        for (int carId = 0; carId < numCars; carId++) {
            switch (carId % 10) {
                case 0: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Ford",   "Focus",   Car.Color.RED,   5, 5000.00) ); break;
                case 1: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Ford",   "Fusion",  Car.Color.RED,   4, 3999.99) ); break;                    
                case 2: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Ford",   "Taurus",  Car.Color.GREEN, 4, 6000.00) ); break;                    
                case 3: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Honda",  "Civic",   Car.Color.WHITE, 5, 4000.00) ); break;                    
                case 4: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Honda",  "Accord",  Car.Color.BLACK, 5, 3000.00) ); break;                    
                case 5: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Honda",  "Insight", Car.Color.GREEN, 3, 5000.00) ); break;                    
                case 6: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Toyota", "Avensis", Car.Color.GREEN, 5, 5999.95) ); break;                    
                case 7: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Toyota", "Prius",   Car.Color.BLUE,  3, 8500.00) ); break;                    
                case 8: cars.add( new Car(carId, "Toyota", "Hilux",   Car.Color.RED,   5, 7800.55) ); break;                    
                case 9: cars.add( new Car(carId, "BMW",    "M6",      Car.Color.BLUE,  2, 9000.23) ); break;                    
                default: throw new IllegalStateException();
            }
        }
        return cars;
    }
}}}

As such, some statistics about the collection:
|| *Color (aka Colour :)* || *% of cars* || *Manufacturer* || *% of cars* || *Number of doors* || *% of cars* ||
|| Red || 30% || Ford || 30% || 5 || 50% ||
|| Green || 30% || Honda || 30% || 4 || 20% ||
|| Blue || 20% || Toyota || 30% || 3 || 20% ||
|| Black || 10% || BMW || 10% || 2 || 10% ||
|| White || 10% ||  ||  || || ||

Because CQEngine uses _lazy evaluation_ throughout, and so it returns `ResultSet`s for every query almost immediately; to measure the performance of CQEngine, these benchmarks retrieve a `ResultSet` from CQEngine, and then iterate through all cars in the result set, simply counting the number of results.

As discussed in some of the examples below, this approach is somewhat _harsh_ on CQEngine, _understating_ its advantages. However this is the only way to fairly compare performance versus iteration in a microbenchmark scenario.

= Benchmarks and Results =

== `HashIndex`: _Retrieve By Unique Key_ ==

Retrieve a single `Car` object from the collection based on `Car.carId` having value 500, which uniquely identifies a car. `HashIndex` on `Car.CAR_ID`.

This example demonstrates CQEngine's support for _constant_ retrieval time regardless of the size of the collection.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.CAR_ID, 500)`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE carId = 500`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/HashIndex_CarId.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *630488.48% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *627369.75% faster* than optimized iteration

== `HashIndex`: _Retrieve Manufacturer "Ford" (large result set)_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.manufacturer` having value "`Ford`". `HashIndex` on `Car.MANUFACTURER`.

This query matches 30,000 cars; 30% of the collection of 100,000 cars. This benchmark example forces CQEngine to iterate all 30,000 cars, even though most applications would not require that many results. In contrast, the iteration approaches can _require_ the _entire_ collection to be iterated, because matching results could be located towards the end of the collection. CQEngine `ResultSet`s intentionally support _paging_ through results, and due to _lazy evaluation_, if the application stops iterating, no unnecessary computations would have been performed. This example is nonetheless to demonstrate CQEngine's performance when a large fraction of the collection is requested and processed.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.MANUFACTURER, "Ford")`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE manufacturer = 'Ford'`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/HashIndex_ManufacturerFord.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *423.17% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *241.83% faster* than optimized iteration

----

== `HashIndex`: _Retrieve Model "Focus" (smaller result set)_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.model` having value "`Focus`". `HashIndex` on `Car.MODEL`.

This query matches 10,000 cars; 10% of the collection of 100,000 cars. CQEngine is less severely penalised compared with the example above; nevertheless is is a large fraction. CQEngine outperforms iteration by a wider margin in this case.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.MODEL, "Focus")`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE model = 'Focus'`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/HashIndex_ModelFocus.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *1627.06% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *1324.17% faster* than optimized iteration

----

== `NavigableIndex`: _Retrieve Price Between_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.price` being _greater than or equal to_ 3000.00 and _less than_ 4000.00. `NavigableIndex` on `Car.PRICE`.

  * CQEngine query: `between(Car.PRICE, 3000.0, true, 4000.0, false)`
    * _Note: true = inclusive, false = exclusive_
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE price >= 3000.0 AND price < 4000.0`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/NavigableIndex_PriceBetween.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *506.08% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *325.89% faster* than optimized iteration

----

== `RadixTreeIndex`: _Retrieve Models Starting With_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.model` starting with "`P`". `RadixTreeIndex` on `Car.model`.

Note: See also `ReversedRadixTreeIndex` which supports _ends with_-type queries. It would have identical performance characteristics as this `RadixTreeIndex` so it was not benchmarked separately.

  * CQEngine query: `startsWith(Car.MODEL, "P")`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE model LIKE 'P%'`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/RadixTreeIndex_ModelStartsWithP.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *1357.81% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *1110.12% faster* than optimized iteration

----

== `SuffixTreeIndex`: _Retrieve Models Containing_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.model` containing "`g`". `SuffixTreeIndex` on `Car.model`.

  * CQEngine query: `contains(Car.MODEL, "g")`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE model LIKE '%g%'`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/SuffixTreeIndex_ModelContainsG.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *1860.53% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *1605.31% faster* than optimized iteration

== Non-Optimal Indexes: _Retrieve Blue Toyota Cars with Three Doors_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.manufacturer` having value "`Toyota`" AND `Car.color` having value `Car.Color.BLUE` AND `Car.doors` having value 3.

`HashIndex` on `Car.DOORS`. _No indexes for Manufacturer or Color_.

This example demonstrates CQEngine's handling of queries for which optimal indexes do not exist. An ideal configuration for this type of query would have a `CompoundIndex` on the three fields above to enable constant time retrieval. However in this instance, only a `HashIndex` on `Car.DOORS` has been added. CQEngine makes the most of the available indexes. In this case it uses the `Car.DOORS` index to reduce the _candidate set_ from 100,000 cars to 20,000 cars, and then it _iterates_ the candidate set, applying _on-the-fly_ filtering to return only those cars which match the rest of the query.

Note also that retrieving *CQEngine Statistics* is much slower in this example than in others. CQEngine Statistics refers to calling *`resultSet.size()`* on a `ResultSet` returned by CQEngine, in preference to determining size by actually iterating and counting the results.

CQEngine can often calculate how many objects _would match_ a query without actually iterating through any objects, based on the internal counts available in entries within indexes. In this example, because indexes are not available to provide complete statistics, CQEngine falls back to counting objects by applying _on-the-fly_ filtering to the candidate set, which incurs a higher cost.

CQEngine can often _accelerate_ the *`resultSet.contains()`* method in a similar fashion (applying set containment tests to individual sets within indexes). In this example, that method would be similarly affected, internally falling back to on-the-fly filtering of the candidate set.

  * CQEngine query:
{{{
and(
    equal(Car.MANUFACTURER, "Toyota"),
    equal(Car.COLOR, Car.Color.BLUE),
    equal(Car.DOORS, 3)
)
}}}
  * SQL equivalent:
{{{
SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE
    manufacturer = 'Toyota'
    AND color = 'blue'
    AND doors = 3
}}}
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/NonOptimalIndexes_ManufacturerToyotaColorBlueDoorsThree.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *172.60% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *136.61% faster* than optimized iteration

== Optimal Indexes - `CompoundIndex`: _Retrieve Blue Toyota Cars with Three Doors_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.manufacturer` having value "`Toyota`" AND `Car.color` having value `Car.Color.BLUE` AND `Car.doors` having value 3. `CompoundIndex` on `Car.MANUFACTURER`, `Car.COLOR`, `Car.DOORS`.

This example demonstrates the improvement in performance when an *optimal* index is added, for the _same query_ as in the non-optimal indexes example above.

  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/CompoundIndex_ManufacturerToyotaColorBlueDoorsThree.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *1625.70% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *1283.20% faster* than optimized iteration

----

== `StandingQueryIndex`: _Retrieve Blue Toyota Cars with Not Five Doors_ ==

Retrieve and iterate `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.manufacturer` having value "`Toyota`" AND `Car.color` having value `Car.Color.BLUE` AND `Car.doors` *NOT* having value 5.

`StandingQueryIndex` on the query. No other indexes.

This example demonstrates `StandingQueryIndex`. This type of index maintains a set of objects matching a _query_, or fragment of a query. As objects are added to and removed from the collection, it tests objects to see if they match the query, adding them to or removing them from this set as necessary. When CQEngine sees a query or fragment of a query for which a standing query index exists, it can retrieve matching objects for that query or query fragment with constant time complexity.

  * CQEngine query:
{{{
and(
    equal(Car.MANUFACTURER, "Toyota"),
    equal(Car.COLOR, Car.Color.BLUE),
    not(equal(Car.DOORS, 5))
)
}}}
  * SQL equivalent:
{{{
SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE
    manufacturer = 'Toyota'
    AND color = 'blue'
    AND doors <> 3
}}}
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/StandingQueryIndex_ManufacturerToyotaColorBlueDoorsNotFive.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *1607.43% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *1299.96% faster* than optimized iteration

== Quantized `HashIndex`: _Retrieve By Unique Key_ ==

Retrieve a single `Car` object from the collection based on `Car.carId` having value 500, which uniquely identifies a car. _Quantized_ `HashIndex` on `Car.CAR_ID` with compression factor 5.

This example demonstrates the effect of *_quantization_* on indexes. Quantization allows the _granularity_ of indexes to be controlled. In this example, the index was created with an `IntegerQuantizer` with compression factor 5. This means that every 5 consecutive `carId`s will be grouped together and stored as a single entry in the index. This reduces the _size_ of the index (reduces memory overhead) and trades it instead for slightly higher _CPU utilization_ during retrieval. The index will need to filter results retrieved from the entry _on-the-fly_, to ensure that they actually match the query.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.CAR_ID, 501)`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE carId = 501`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/Quantized_HashIndex_CarId.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *481984.43% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *467645.90% faster* than optimized iteration

----

== Quantized `NavigableIndex`: _Retrieve !CarId Between_ ==

Retrieve three `Car` objects from the collection based on `Car.carId` having values between 500 and 502. _Quantized_ `NavigableIndex` on `Car.CAR_ID` with compression factor 5.

This example demonstrates that _quantization_ can be applied to navigable indexes, with minimal overhead on _range_-type queries. CQEngine applies _on-the-fly_ filtering only to quantized entries at the _start_ and/or _end_ of ranges.

  * CQEngine query: `between(Car.CAR_ID, 500, 502)`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE carId BETWEEN 500 AND 502`
  * Source code: [http://cqengine.googlecode.com/svn/cqengine/trunk/src/test/java/com/googlecode/cqengine/benchmark/tasks/Quantized_NavigableIndex_CarId.java here]

*Benchmark Results*

  * CQEngine is *330187.50% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *325727.79% faster* than optimized iteration
