=== Retrieve By Unique Key ===

Retrieve a single `Car` object from the collection of 100,000 cars, based on `Car.carId`having value `500`, which uniquely identifies a car. `HashIndex` on `carId`.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.CAR_ID, 500)`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE carId = 500`

*Results*

  * CQEngine is *630488.48% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *627369.75% faster* than optimized iteration

=== Retrieve cars manufactured by "Ford" ===
Retrieve and iterate 30,000 `Car` objects from the collection of 100,000 cars, based on `Car.manufacturer` having value "`Ford`". `HashIndex` on `manufacturer`.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.MANUFACTURER, "Ford")`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE manufacturer = 'Ford'`

*Results*

  * CQEngine is *423.17% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *241.83% faster* than optimized iteration

=== Retrieve cars with model "Focus" ===
Retrieve and iterate 10,000 `Car` objects from the collection of 100,000 cars, based on `Car.model` having value "`Focus`". `HashIndex` on `model`.

  * CQEngine query: `equal(Car.MODEL, "Focus")`
  * SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM cars WHERE model = 'Focus'`

*Results*

  * CQEngine is *1627.06% faster* than naive iteration
  * CQEngine is *1324.17% faster* than optimized iteration
