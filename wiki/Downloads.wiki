    <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>

== Download for Non-Maven Projects ==
For non-Maven projects, a special build of the library is also provided, built with [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/ maven-shade-plugin], which contains the library and all of the library's own dependencies packaged in a single jar file (ending "-all"). This build can be downloaded directly from [http://code.google.com/p/cqengine/downloads/list here].
